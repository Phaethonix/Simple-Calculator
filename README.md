I love alexkdeveloper's calculator [https://github.com/alexkdeveloper/calculator](url), but he has archived his repository, so I made a .sh version like his for personal use but decided to share it for anyone who might need it. 

Just download and run `chmod +x calc.sh` — it should work, I think. This is my first repo, so forgive me if I’m missing something.
