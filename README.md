I love [Alexkdeveloper's calculator](https://github.com/alexkdeveloper/calculator), but since the repository has been archived, I created a `.sh` version similar to his for personal use. However, I decided to share it in case anyone else might find it useful.  

To use it, simply download the script and run:  
```bash
chmod +x calc.sh
```  
It should work, but since this is my first repository, please forgive me if I missed anything.
